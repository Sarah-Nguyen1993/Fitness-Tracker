# Fitness-Tracker
## Description
Fitness Tracker is an application that allows users to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. The app is created to help consumers reach their fitness goals faster because they can track their workout progress. With Fitness Tracker, users can track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercises. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, users can also track their distance traveled.
## Usage
When first arrving to the application, users will be prompted the stats of their last workout if there is any. Users can either continue or add new workout. Depending on the type of exercise, users insert different information for the exercise. If the exercise is a resistance exercise, users will log the exercise name, weight, reps, sets, and duration. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, exercise name, distance, and duration are needed. The Dashboard tab on the upper left corner contains stats of a user's exercises performed in the last seven days.
